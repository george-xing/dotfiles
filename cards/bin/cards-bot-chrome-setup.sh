# cards-bot-chrome-setup.sh — one-time bootstrap for the persistent cards Chrome.
#
# What this does:
#   1. Verify port 19223 isn't already taken (would prevent daemon binding).
#   2. Create the persistent user-data-dir at the canonical path.
#   3. Verify the LaunchAgent plist symlink resolves into the dotfiles repo.
#   4. Print the launchctl bootstrap command + manual sign-in instructions
#      for Chase and Amex.
#
# What this deliberately doesn't do:
#   - Copy cookies from your real Chrome profile. We learned via the twitter
#     setup that route brings WAL corruption hazards and produces cookies
#     with weird provenance. Instead, the daemon launches with an empty
#     profile and you sign into chase.com + americanexpress.com interactively
#     ONCE in the bot Chrome window. That window stays open under launchd;
#     cookies accumulate naturally with correct device fingerprint.
#   - Quit any running Chrome. Doesn't touch the user's daily Chrome at all.
#     Multiple Chrome.app instances with different --user-data-dirs coexist
#     fine (Chromium's process singleton is keyed to the data dir). Cards bot
#     Chrome will run alongside twitter bot Chrome AND the user's daily Chrome.

===> Next steps (manual):

1. Load the daemon:
     launchctl bootstrap gui/\$(id -u) "$PLIST"

2. Wait ~3 seconds, then verify the daemon is listening:
     curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:${DEBUG_PORT}/json/version

   Expected: a JSON blob with "Browser":"Chrome/<version>".

3. A Chrome window will appear (the cards bot's). Sign in to BOTH banks in
   this window — cookies persist forever in the bot's user-data-dir at:
     $PERSISTENT_DIR

   a) Navigate to https://secure.chase.com/web/auth/dashboard
      - Sign in. Complete any MFA challenge.
      - CHECK "remember this device" if offered.
      - Confirm you land on the dashboard.

   b) Open a new tab → https://global.americanexpress.com/
      - Sign in. Complete any MFA challenge.
      - CHECK "remember this device" if offered.
      - Confirm you land on the account summary.

4. Leave both tabs open. The skill will navigate to the offers pages on
   each fire; tabs stay logged in for weeks/months. When a session
   eventually expires, the skill hard-fails with kind:auth — just open
   this same bot Chrome window and sign back in.

5. Sanity-check the daemon + prefire end-to-end:
     ~/dotfiles/cards/bin/cards-prefire.sh
     # Last line should be: SAVED_FRONTMOST_PID=<pid>

   The full skill fire (cards-fire.sh credit-card-offers) requires the
   SKILL.md to be in place — that's phase 3 of the build, after this
   bootstrap.

NEVER do these — they were considered and rejected:
  - Don't import cookies from your daily Chrome. Bank cookies frequently
    pin to a device fingerprint that won't transfer cleanly, causing
    immediate re-auth challenges.
  - Don't try to automate the credential entry. The skill is engineered
    to NEVER type into any input field on banking sites, ever.
  - Don't run this on a different machine. The "trusted device" cookies
    are bound to this Mac mini's network/hardware fingerprint.
